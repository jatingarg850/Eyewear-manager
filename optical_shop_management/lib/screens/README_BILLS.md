# Bills Screen Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Bills screen and Bill Detail screen for the Optical Shop Management application.

## Files Created

### 1. `bills_screen.dart`
Main bills listing screen with the following features:
- **Search functionality**: Filter bills by customer name, phone number, or date
- **Sort options**: Recent First, Oldest First, Highest Amount
- **Bill list**: Uses ListView.builder with BillTile widgets for efficient rendering
- **FAB**: Floating action button to create new bills
- **Empty states**: Friendly messages when no bills exist or search returns no results
- **Error handling**: Displays error messages with retry functionality
- **Integration**: Uses BillProvider for state management

### 2. `bill_detail_screen.dart`
Detailed view of a single bill with the following sections:
- **Customer Information**: Name and phone number with icons
- **Line Items Table**: Product name, category badge, quantity, unit price, and total price
- **Pricing Breakdown**: Subtotal, special discount, additional discount, and total amount
- **Payment Method**: Color-coded badge with icon (Cash/Card/UPI)
- **Timestamp**: Billing date and creation date
- **Actions**: Share button (placeholder) and delete button with confirmation dialog

## Key Features

### Search and Filter
- Real-time search as user types
- Searches across customer name, phone number, and date
- Clear button to reset search
- Maintains search state during screen lifecycle

### Sort Options
- Recent First (default): Sorts by billing date descending
- Oldest First: Sorts by billing date ascending
- Highest Amount: Sorts by total amount descending
- Dialog-based sort selection with radio buttons

### Bill Detail View
- Comprehensive bill information display
- Color-coded payment method badges:
  - Cash: Green (#10b981)
  - Card: Blue (#3b82f6)
  - UPI: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Discount calculations showing both percentage and fixed amounts
- Delete confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- Success/error feedback via SnackBar

## Navigation

### Routes Required
The implementation expects the following routes to be configured:
- `/bill-detail`: Navigate to bill detail screen (passes Bill object as argument)
- `/create-bill`: Navigate to create bill flow (to be implemented in task 12)

## State Management

### BillProvider Integration
The screens use the following BillProvider methods:
- `loadBills()`: Load all bills from database
- `deleteBill(String id)`: Delete a bill by ID
- `bills`: List of all bills
- `isLoading`: Loading state indicator
- `error`: Error message if any

## UI/UX Considerations

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Scrollable content for long lists and detailed views
- Proper padding and spacing using AppTheme constants

### Accessibility
- Semantic labels for icons
- Tooltip text for action buttons
- Sufficient color contrast
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements

### Performance
- ListView.builder for efficient list rendering
- Local filtering and sorting (no database queries)
- Minimal rebuilds using Consumer widget

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 2.6
✅ Search bills by customer name, phone number, or date
✅ Display bill list with customer info, amount, payment method
✅ Sort bills by different criteria

### Requirement 2.5
✅ Display complete bill details including line items
✅ Show pricing breakdown with discounts
✅ Display payment method and timestamps

## Future Enhancements
- Implement share functionality (currently placeholder)
- Add bill export to PDF
- Add bill printing capability
- Implement bill editing
- Add filters by date range and payment method
- Add bill statistics and analytics

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test search with various queries (name, phone, partial matches)
2. Test all sort options with different bill datasets
3. Test delete functionality with confirmation
4. Test empty states (no bills, no search results)
5. Test error handling (database errors, network issues)
6. Test navigation between bills list and detail screens
7. Test with bills containing different payment methods
8. Test with bills containing multiple line items and discounts
